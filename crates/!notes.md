TODO:
- add percentage chances
- add roll animation
- add multipage support for crates admin menu
- implement catch safe for rare edge case where when player holds black stained glass pane named " " and double clicks on it he'll take all of them from admin gui lol (minor priority as its only accessible to admins)
- add virtual crate opening option
- refactor the way it checks inventory click interactions by using contains for more direct performant comparison
